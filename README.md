# File-Seaker-

This nit script allows it's user to search for certain files stored in their computer machine.
Lot's of time i found my self searching the location of files in my computer for hours.
Usinng this python program helps this task.
Two pain operations take placce:

1) Directory search for of a certain file.
2) File search of a specific type.

As an added feature, the script allows you to choose the direcory that the search takes place,
with one of 'em being a custom directory.

As a result, the is a third indirect operation, than is, to view all the files in a specific directory.

Note: a directory will most likely have subdirectoris, as an intended function, the program will look to those subdirecories,
in order to return a correct output
